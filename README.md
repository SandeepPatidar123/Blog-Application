# Blog-Application
Created a dynamic blog application using the MERN stack. Implemented user authentication, CRUD functionality for posts and comments, and responsive design. Leveraged MongoDB for data storage, Express.js and Node.js for the backend, and React for the frontend. Deployed the application to showcase full-stack development skills.
